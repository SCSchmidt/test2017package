## What am I doing here?
I am just trying around and creating stuff.

```{r try, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
anlaeg <- read.csv("../data/anlaeg_all_25832.csv") 
  anlaeg<-anlaeg[1:10,]
new_function(anlaeg$fra_aar) -> kya
```

## Including Tables

If I now have done this great stuff, I can see, whether we can see this in our Table \@ref(tab:table).

```{r table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(kya, caption = "Wow, look at this!")
```
