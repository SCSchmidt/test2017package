```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(knitr)
```


## What am I doing here?
I am just trying around and creating stuff.

```{r try, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
anlaeg <- read.csv("../data/anlaeg_all_25832.csv") 
  anlaeg<-anlaeg[1:10,]
new_function(anlaeg$fra_aar) -> kya
```

## Including Tables

If I now have done this great stuff, I can see, whether we can see this in our Table \@ref(tab:tableso).
I don't really know, why this ref is not working. But at least the warning messages are gone.

```{r tableso , echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(kya, caption = "Wow, look at this!")
```
